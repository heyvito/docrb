Docrb is an opinionated documentation generator for Ruby projects. It works by
parsing source-code and comments preceding classes, modules, attributes, and
methods, and generates a static website with its findings. You can check
[Logrb's documentation](https://heyvito.github.io/logrb) to see Docrb
in action!

> **Beta quality!** Hey there! As far as we are already using Docrb on a few
projects (some private, some public), there may still be some rough edges. In
case you run into any issue, please do tell us using GitHub's issue tracker! ðŸ’•

## Installing

Install the `docrb` by executing the following command:

```
gem install docrb
```

## Using

As mentioned in the previous section, Docrb is an **opinionated** documentation
generator. This means that it uses a specific formatting in order to infer
methods, annotations and references. As long as your project adheres to those
conventions, Docrb will be able to automatically generate and augment your
documentation.

#### Simple Example

```ruby

# Internal: foo raises an ZeroDivisionError
def foo
  3 / 0
end
```

The block above will be enough to emit a documentation for it including a label
indicating the method is considered to be "Internal". The following prefixes
are handled by Docrb automatically:

- Private
- Public
- Internal
- Deprecated

As long as a documentation block begins with one of the keywords above (case
insensitive) followed by a colon, Docrb will annotate the method accordingly.

#### Documenting parameters

When documenting parameters, just place a blank line between the main
documentation, followed by an **aligned** list of parameters. For instance:

```ruby
# Greets a provided name with an optional greeting
#
# name      - The person's name
# greeting: - The greeting to use. Defaults to "Oi"
def greet(name, greeting: nil)
  greeting ||= "Oi"
  "#{greeting} #{name}"
end
```

#### Adding code examples

Docrb can highlight code examples automatically too! Just add an extra
indentation level to create a code example block:

```ruby
# Greets a provided name with an optional greeting
#
# name      - The person's name
# greeting: - The greeting to use. Defaults to "Oi"
#
# Usage example:
#
#   greet("Fefo", "Aye")
#   # => Aye Fefo
def greet(name, greeting: nil)
  greeting ||= "Oi"
  "#{greeting} #{name}"
end
```

#### Adding references
Docrb automatically searches for references to other methods and classes/modules.
The following patterns are assumed as references and linked automatically:

 - `#method_name`
 - `ModuleOrClass.method_name`
 - `ModuleOrClass#method_name`
 - `ModuleOrClass::ChildModuleOrClass.method_name`
 - `ModuleOrClass::ChildModuleOrClass#method_name`
 - `::SomeRootClass#method_name`
 - `::SomeRootClass.method_name`
 - `::SomeRootClass.method_name`
 - `ModuleOrClass`
 - `ModuleOrClass::ChildModuleOrClass`
 - `::ModuleOrClass`

## Generating Documentation

Simply `cd` to your project's directory, and invoke the `docrb` utility.
For instance, the following command line is used to generate Logrb's
documentation, which is then generated on an `output` directory:

```bash
$ docrb -blib . output
```

The tool can usually detect all it needs, but if needed, extra options may
be provided:

```
$ docrb --help

Usage: bin/docrb [options] [input directory] [output directory]
        --help                       Prints this help
    -b, --base=PATH                  Base directory to search for source files. Defaults to the provided input directory.
    -r, --readme=PATH                Path for README.md file. When omitted, Docrb searches for a README.md file in the provided input directory.
    -n, --name=NAME                  Name of the project being documented. When omitted, Docrb attempts to extract information from a .gemspec file in the provided input directory.
    -s, --summary=SUMMARY            Short summary of the project being documented. When omitted, Docrb attempts to extract information from a .gemspec file in the provided input directory.
    -h, --host=URL                   URL for the gem's hosted URL. When omitted, Docrb attempts to extract information from a .gemspec file in the provided input directory.
    -g, --git-repo=URL               URL for the repository containing the documented project. When omitted, Docrb attempts to extract this information from the .git directory present in the provided input directory, if any.
        --authors a,b,c              List of name of project authors. When omitted, Docrb attempts to extract information from a .gemspec file in the provided input directory.
    -l, --license=LICENSE            The project's license. When omitted, Docrb attempts to extract information from a .gemspec file in the provided input directory.
```

## Contributing

Yay! Contributions are more than welcome!
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get a summary on how to hack Docrb.
Also, ensure to take a look at our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)!
Everyone interacting in the Docrb project's codebases, issue trackers,
chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow it. Rule of thumb: be nice.
